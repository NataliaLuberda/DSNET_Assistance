# Automatic Reservation and Payment System
## Python Project 2023

As part of our Python course, my colleague and I have developed a desktop application that serves as an automatic reservation system for rooms, laundry facilities, and dryers at our university, the AGH University of Science and Technology. Additionally, we have enriched our application with a calendar feature that allows users to track events taking place at AGH. As part of the system's functionality, users also have the ability to check out dates from dormitories and make payments while obtaining information about accommodation-related expenses.

## Our project provides the following features:

* Reservation of rooms, laundry facilities, and dryers on the university campus.
* Ability for users to select reservation dates.
* Integration of a calendar that allows users to track planned events at AGH as well as user-specific events related to matters such as payment deadlines or check-out dates.
* Accommodation-related payments, including payment reminders and QR code handling.
* Our application aims to streamline the reservation process and facilitate calendar management for users.
